## Feature Description

<!-- Brief description of what you want to add -->

## Use Case

<!-- Why is this needed? What problem does it solve? -->

## Proposed API

<!-- If applicable, sketch the REST endpoint or MQTT topic -->

```typescript
// Example: GET /api/v1/...
```

## Examples (BDD)

<!-- Describe behavior with Given/When/Then scenarios -->

**Scenario 1:**

```gherkin
Given [initial context]
When [action occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
```

**Scenario 2:**

```gherkin
Given [initial context]
When [action occurs]
Then [expected outcome]
```

- [ ] Requires new dependencies? (justify if yes)
- [ ] Impacts performance? (describe)
- [ ] Breaking change?
